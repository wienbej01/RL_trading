# PPO-LSTM Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the design for enhancing the PPO-LSTM policy to support multi-ticker trading in the RL trading system. The enhancements include modifications to the policy architecture, observation handling, and training procedures to effectively handle multiple tickers simultaneously.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Multi-Ticker Support**: Enhance PPO-LSTM policy to handle multiple tickers
2. **Portfolio Management**: Integrate portfolio-level decision making
3. **Cross-Ticker Dependencies**: Model dependencies between different tickers
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Design architecture that scales with number of tickers
5. **Attention Mechanisms**: Implement attention mechanisms for ticker selection
6. **Hierarchical Decision Making**: Support hierarchical decision making (portfolio â†’ ticker)
7. **Curriculum Learning**: Implement curriculum learning for gradual complexity increase
8. **Entropy Annealing**: Add entropy annealing schedules for exploration control
9. **Learning Rate Schedules**: Implement adaptive learning rate schedules
10. **
