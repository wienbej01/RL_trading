# Gemini Trading System Debugging State

## Summary of Work

1.  **Initial Analysis:** Analyzed documentation to identify the Lagrangian activity shaping and reward system as key areas for the trade imbalance issue.
2.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fixed a `TypeError` in the feature selection pipeline (`src/features/pipeline.py`).
    *   Corrected incorrect path resolution in the config loader (`src/utils/config_loader.py`).
    *   Resolved a logging-related `TypeError` in the backtest script (`scripts/walkforward_train_eval.py`).
    *   Fixed self-introduced `IndentationError` and `NameError` in the RL environment (`src/sim/env_intraday_rl.py`).
3.  **Configuration Update:**
    *   Retired the old `settings.yaml`, replacing it with `optimized_settings.yaml`.
    *   Updated all file references to point to the new `settings.yaml`.
    *   Corrected the activity shaping parameters in `configs/settings.yaml` to align with the code's implementation.
4.  **Performance Debugging:**
    *   Identified that the backtest is running extremely slowly, not hanging.
    *   Pinpointed the `step` method within the RL environment as the primary performance bottleneck.
    *   Instrumented the `step` method with detailed, targeted timing logs to isolate the exact cause of the slowdown.

## Next Steps

1.  **Analyze Timing Logs:** Run the backtest script (`run_backtest.sh`) for a short period (15-20 seconds) to generate timing logs from the instrumented `step` method.
2.  **Isolate Bottleneck:** Analyze the generated logs to identify the specific code block within the `step` method that is causing the major slowdown.
3.  **Optimize Code:** Propose and implement a targeted optimization for the identified bottleneck.
4.  **Validate Performance:** Run the backtest again to confirm that the performance issue is resolved and the simulation runs at a reasonable speed.
5.  **Validate Logic:** Once performance is acceptable, run a complete backtest to finally validate that the activity shaping changes have corrected the trade imbalance and the agent is trading within the desired frequency.
6.  **Address Data Availability:** After validating the single-ticker `BBVA` backtest, proceed to debug and execute the data download for the multi-ticker setup.
