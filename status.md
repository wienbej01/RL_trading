## Project Status

**Current State:**
- The `technical_indicators.py` and `microstructure_features.py` files have been fixed by adding the necessary imports.
- The `calculate_vol_of_vol`, `calculate_sma_slope`, and `calculate_obv` functions have been re-added to `technical_indicators.py`.
- The `generate_spy_features.py` script has been successfully run, and a new feature set with 10 selected features has been generated.
- The VIX data loading issue has been fixed in `pipeline.py`.
- The reward function in `env_intraday_rl.py` has been enhanced to support multiple reward types, including Differential Sharpe Ratio, and a reward scaling parameter has been added to control the magnitude of the rewards.
- The training script `train.py` is being executed. A `TypeError` was fixed by ensuring the dataframe has a `DatetimeIndex`. A `ValueError` was fixed by wrapping the environment in a `DummyVecEnv` for evaluation. The `batch_size` has been adjusted to an optimal value. The `learning_rate` has been lowered to mitigate the KL divergence issue. The rewards are now also clipped to the range [-1, 1]. The reward type has been temporarily changed to `pnl` to isolate the KL divergence issue. The training is still failing with an early stopping due to high KL divergence. The model has been simplified to an `MlpPolicy` to debug the training instability.
- A new script `evaluate_model.py` has been created to evaluate the trained model.

**Next Steps:**
- The next logical step would be to train a new model using the new features and the enhanced reward function.
- After training, the model should be evaluated to see if the changes have improved its performance.
- The trained model is now being evaluated.
